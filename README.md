Azimuth - the chemical database of biology

**The repo Wiki is used for organization.**


## Three sub-Databases, with associated applications

* serve released metabolic models (app: azimuth-serve)

  The operational model is similar to MiSigDB, which serves GSEA and community. 

* store information towards curating new reactions and pathways (app: azimuth-curate)

  An upgrade path of metabolic models.

* store processed, structured mass spectrometry data (app: azimuth-extract)

  Culminating computable data, enabling new scientific discoveries.
